Version 0.1.3
-------------

Bugfix release.

  group.

Version 0.1.2.1
---------------

Bugfix release.

- Corrected the broken tagging of 0.1.2. Updated some version numbers.

Version 0.1.2
-------------

Bugfix release.

- Fixed #1710252: occasionally deep in a hierarchy, things weren't being
  rebuilt when they should be (a combination of cfile { dynamicheaders }
  not rebuilding the dynamicheaders, and file {} not expanding its filename).

Version 0.1.1
-------------

Bugfix release.

- Added CHANGELOG and LICENSE files.
- Fixed #1577432: c.pm rules weren't honouring {PARENT, ...} in some
  circumstances.

  for use by scripts.
- Some portability tweaks.
